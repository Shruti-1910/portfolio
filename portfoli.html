            <p>Hey! My name is Shruti Kumari, and I am from the steel city of India, yes, Jamshedpur. The city in Jharkhand. I was born in the year 2001 in Gujarat. I returned to my hometown in 2006. I have completed my Matriculation and Intermediate from Kerala Public School with Science as my main subject.</p>
            <p><br>I took up computer science as an optional subject in senior high school, but I failed miserably. I was so discouraged, but I knew that I didn't want to give up on my dream of becoming a coder. I found a teacher who had a different pedagogy, and it was like a lightbulb went off in my head. I started to understand computer science, and I began to get straight 90s in my classes.</p>
            <p><br>My success in computer science sparked my passion for coding. I decided to major in Computer Applications for my bachelor's degree, and I even helped a friend develop an app. This experience gave me a taste of what it was like to work on a real-world coding project, and it further solidified my passion for coding.</p>
             <p><br>After graduating from college, I took the Tata Steel Apprenticeship test. I didn't pass the test the first time, but I didn't give up. I studied harder and took the test again, and this time I was successful. I joined Tata Steel as an Operations and Maintenance Assistant, and my job required me to develop problem-solving, analytical, and intrapersonal skills. These skills, along with my hard skills in coding, helped me succeed in my role at Tata Steel.</p>
            <p><br>I am currently pursuing a Master's degree in Computer Applications at Christ University in Bangalore. I am eager to continue learning and growing in my field, and I am confident that I have the skills and experience to make a significant contribution to the tech industry.<br><br>I am proud of my journey, and I am grateful for the challenges that I have faced. These challenges have made me a stronger and more resilient person, and they have helped me to achieve my goals. I am excited to see what the future holds, and I am confident that I will continue to succeed in my career.</p>
